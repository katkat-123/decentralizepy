decentralizepy
==============

decentralizepy is a framework for running distributed applications (particularly ML) on top of arbitrary topologies (decentralized, federated, parameter server).
It was primarily conceived for assessing scientific ideas on several aspects of distributed learning (communication efficiency, privacy, data heterogeneity etc.).

-------------------------
Setting up decentralizepy
-------------------------

* Fork the repository.
* Clone and enter your local repository.
* Check if you have ``python>=3.8``. ::

    python --version

* (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment. ::
  
    python3 -m venv [venv-name]
    source [venv-name]/bin/activate

* Update pip. ::

    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade pip

* On Mac M1, installing ``pyzmq`` fails with `pip`. Use `conda <https://conda.io>`_.
* Install decentralizepy for development. (zsh) ::

    pip3 install --editable .\[dev\]
    
* Install decentralizepy for development. (bash) ::

    pip3 install --editable .[dev]

* Download CIFAR-10 using ``download_dataset.py``. ::

    python download_dataset.py

* (Optional) Download other datasets from LEAF <https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf> and place them in ``eval/data/``.
 
----------------
Running the code
----------------

* Follow the tutorial in ``tutorial/``. OR,
* Generate a new graph file with the required topology using ``generate_graph.py``. ::

    python generate_graph.py --help

* Choose and modify one of the config files in ``eval/{step,epoch}_configs``.
* Modify the dataset paths and ``addresses_filepath`` in the config file.
* In eval/run.sh, modify arguments as required.
* Execute eval/run.sh on all the machines simultaneously. There is a synchronization barrier mechanism at the start so that all processes start training together.
